  What follows is a 100-word paragraph on the brick manufacturing process, provided by Grok.
  <br><br>
  Commercial brick manufacturing commences with raw material procurement, 
  wherein clay, shale, and sand aggregates are excavated and pulverized in 
  primary crushers to achieve uniform particle size distribution below 50 mm. 
  Subsequent pug milling incorporates water and additives like plasticizers to 
  form a cohesive pug, extruded through a de-aired vacuum press at 200-500 psi 
  into columnar slugs. Wire-cut machinery slices slugs into green bricks, which 
  undergo mechanical setting on kiln cars. Firing in tunnel kilns at 900-1200Â°C 
  induces vitrification via solid-state diffusion and flux-mediated sintering, 
  yielding compressive strengths exceeding 10 MPa per ASTM C62 standards. 
  Post-cooling, bricks are cubically tumbled for surface texture, inspected for 
  efflorescence, and palletized for dispatch.
