	<h1>Joe's Weird Stories</h1> 
	<p>
		On this site I will be writing weird little things to <em>confound</em> and <em>amuse</em>. This will serve as a dumping ground for my brain compartments.<br>
		Hopefully, my mental housecleaning can serve as some small nose-exhalation-inducing entertainment for someone in the world. Or not, I don't really care. Here is an image of a burrito.

		<li> A Burrito should consist of: </li>
        <li> tortilla</li>
        <li> carne asada </li>
        <li> guacamole</li>
        <li> refried beans</li>
        <li>french fries</li><br>

     <h2>What follows are personal introductions written by three different language models, each given the same prompt.</h2>
      <strong>(I have selectively edited, italicized, and bolded certain words. Copilot in particular was not very good at this.)</strong><br><br>
	 "A little about me: I am collector of used fortune-cookie fortunes and ornamental cabbages. <br>
	 I once won a staring contest with a taxidermied owl, and I haven’t blinked since. <br>
	 My hobbies include cataloging the dreams of strangers, reenacting historical events using sock puppets, <br>
	 and maintaining eye contact with mirrors until they blink first. I live in a house shaped like a question mark <br>
	 and sleep in a drawer labeled 'miscellaneous.' If you hear humming in the walls, <em>don’t worry—it’s just my thoughts escaping.</em>"<br>-Copilot<br><br>
	 
	 "A little about me: I collect <em>forgotten keys</em> from <em>abandoned houses</em>, convinced they unlock alternate realities. <br>
	 My left hand writes poetry in a language only birds understand. I once outran a <strong>thunderstorm</strong> by whispering apologies to the clouds. <br>
	 My favorite snack is expired yogurt fermented with midnight thoughts. <br>
	 And lately, my shadow has started leaving me notes—mostly warnings about myself."<br>-Grok<br><br>
	 
	 "I collect antique mannequin limbs—not for resale, just for the company. <br>
	 I once taught a crow to mimic my ex-girlfriend's laugh, and now it won't stop. <br>
	 Every Tuesday, I wear a wig made entirely of doll hair I found at estate sales (only <em>Tuesdays</em>, though—I’m not insane). <br>
	 I can recite every line from a 1973 toothpaste commercial that only aired once in Denmark. <br>
	 And I haven't slept since 2019—not because I can't, but because I don't want to see <strong>him</strong> again. <br>So yeah, I'm pretty chill."<br>-ChatGPT<br>
